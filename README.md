# Problem reproduction

This is a reproduction repo for an Angular issue (TODO: add link to the github issue).

## Steps to reproduce

* checkout the repo
* `npm install`
* `ng serve` (application loads correctly, console confirms that `LOCALE_ID = fr-FR`)
* `ng test` (fails, `Error: Expected '' to equal 'fr-FR'`)
